## Understanding This Report

### Confidence Ratings

- ★★★★ (4 stars): Expert-reviewed, multiple studies confirm association
- ★★★ (3 stars): Strong evidence from peer-reviewed research
- ★★ (2 stars): Moderate evidence, findings may be preliminary
- ★ (1 star): Limited evidence, interpretation with caution

### Risk Levels

- **High**: Significantly elevated risk compared to general population
- **Moderate**: Moderately elevated risk, lifestyle factors may influence outcome
- **Low**: Slightly elevated or average risk
- **Protective**: Reduced risk compared to general population

## Disclaimer

This report is for **informational and educational purposes only**. Genetic risk estimates are based on population studies and may not apply to individuals. Many diseases are influenced by multiple genes, lifestyle, and environmental factors not captured in this analysis.

**This is NOT a diagnostic tool.** Please consult with a qualified healthcare professional or genetic counselor to discuss these findings and any recommended follow-up testing.
